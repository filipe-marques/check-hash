### Contributing to Check Hash project

Here are the rules to promote a good relationship between developers and the community:

#### Issues

1. Be polite and kind
2. Describe what happens and how to test to reproduce that error

#### Pull Requests

1. To fix a issue: one pull request per issue
2. To implement an idea: one pull request per idea
